# OODP 23/24

## Introduction
This is my repository for the course OODP.
Most, if not all of my assignments and projects will be stored here.

## Repository Structure

For convenience, the repository is divided into the following directories:
- {week number} - Contains the assignments for that week
  - {Lesson number} - Contains the assignments for that lesson
    - Class Assignments - Contains the class assignments
      - {Assignment} - Contains the assignment*
    - Homework Assignments - Contains the homework assignments
      - {Assignment} - Contains the assignment*

*Assignment format: Week.Lesson.CourseOrHomework+AssignmentNumber AssignmentName

## Notes
> My student number is: 1037046 

> All assignments are also submitted in CodeGrade. Some grades will be a 5 or lower, this is because the unit tests are not 100% correct. The code itself is correct and the assignments are completed.

> If someone is reading this, copying the code in any shape or form is not allowed.
> If you use the code anyway, please note that I literally have a full commit history of the code with a date and time attached to it..
